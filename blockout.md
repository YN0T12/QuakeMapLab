## Blockout

When creating the initial block out for the first version of my map I tried to follow my top-down layout image as perfectly as I could.

One thing I added was the addition of catwalks. It was in my original vision but I didn't know how to sketch it on the layout image without overcrowding it.

When creating the map I used prototype textures. I used different textures for the floors/ceiling and the walls as well as different colored textures for any props or any different rooms. Like if I wanted a room to be more wooden I would use brown or for a room with blood on the floor I'd make the floor red colored.

I used these blockouts as an easy way to playtest and iterate on the maps without putting in the full amount of effort of making a finished map with lighting, textures, and finished models.
