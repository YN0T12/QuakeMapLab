# Preproduction 

## Sketchwork

I was very excited when I was given this design challenge. The first thing I did when I heard that I was going to be designing a multiplayer deathmatch level was quickly sketch down all of the ideas I had in to my binder on the train ride home. I eventually sketched a rudimentary top-down layout of the map I had in mind.

When showing off this to my friends it was difficult to read and understand as you can probably tell. Because of that, I ended up putting together a document of all of my ideas as well as creating a more professional top-down layout. This helped me expand on my ideas.

## Theming and Ideas

* The theme I ended up on was an abandoned laboratory.

* I wished for the map to have an emphasis on height control. 
  * The players who are higher up have a better vantage point and are more protected however, there’s less healing and ammo the higher up you are. While the players on the bottom levels are more vulnerable but have access to more items around. 

* Visually I wanted a lot of destroyed furniture and objects as well as signs of decay like hanging vines, broken lights, and holes in the walls ceiling, and floors.
  * Originally the map was supposed to turn out more green but when searching through textures to add I came across a bunch of textures that were icy and snowy that I thought would be fun to use. (see: [Textures and Lighting](textures-and-lighting.md))

* I also liked the idea of having small thin hallways and ramps followed by large open rooms.
  *  This idea didn't come to be as playtesters didn't like long hallways and open rooms as there was nowhere to hide and take cover. (see: [Playtesting and Iteration](playtesting-and-iteration.md))

* I also wanted visual storytelling to give the idea that there was some monster who broke free from containment and destroyed everything and that’s why it’s abandoned.
  * Originally there were supposed to be more containment tubes with monsters still trapped inside as well as a doomsday button that released all of them. Unfortunately, I learned that enemies don't load in Deathmatch mode. This idea would've probably been too gimmicky anyways...

## Insperation

I have never really played that many shooters and I never played Quake before so when coming up with ideas for my map I looked to other places.

One of my main inspirations came from earlier this year when I went on a trip to Wilderness Wisconsin Dells. There they had a laser tag map that my friends and I tried out.

This map had a large tower with ramps to climb up and balconies to shoot down from. I really enjoyed the aspect of hiding around the corners and above the ramps, shooting down from the people trying to move up. The peak of the tower ended up becoming like a base camp I was trying to protect as it gave the best advantage. This is why I designed my map with verticality involved. 

This however sounds really campy (which it was) which is where the benefit of Quake comes in. In Quake when you're low on ammo or health you need to pick up items to refill either one. So if I made a high vantage point that players wanted to protect I needed to make sure they eventually had to come out of hiding and collect these items to refill. 

This idea eventually came to be the metal catwalks. Originally I was going to dedicate a whole floor to this idea being the Attic seen in the top-down sketches but it ended up making the map too large and I made the floor too difficult to find.
