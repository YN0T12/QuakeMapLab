# Playtesting and Iteration

## Playtesting Method

A group of designers and I challenged ourselves to create Quake multiplayer deathmatch maps together, and at the end of every week, we would play each other's maps and give feedback to each other using feedback forms. Thanks to this I was able to get good feedback on my map as well as discover things I like in other people's maps. Using their ideas to improve my own map. 

## Version 1 - Initial blockout

This version of the map can be see in the [Blockout](blockout.md) section of the Process Journal. as I mentioned there I designed this first blockout as close as I can to my initial top-down layout sketch (see: [Preproduction](preproduction.md))

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get as much playtesting as I liked after this version. The map was only played by 3 people including myself. Because of that, I couldn't get a really good playtest experience and I wasn't able to get the info I needed about the state of my map. Even so, I continued forward with my design trying to improve on it for the next playtest session.

## Version 2 - Iteration and Decoration

This version of the map saw the addition of decorations. Filling the empty rooms and spaces with props and set pieces helping the players not get so lost in the repeating white empty rooms. This also involved filling out large empty spaces with cover for players to hide behind.

Adding pipes and vents along the walls made the place feel more real and industrial. Potted plants as well as chairs and tables made it seem more welcoming to guests and gave employees a place to go during their breaks. And my favorite addition was the lab tables. This really helped to sell the idea that you were inside a lab and not some office building. These tables also helped fill out large empty spaces with some much-needed cover.

I was also able to finish the outside area which was just an empty space before. Although it wasn't very detailed and not too much work was put into the outside like the inside was.

But what did the playtesters think?

Luckily, this time I was able to do a larger play session having 8 players play on my map as it was meant to be played. I got a lot of praise for the decorations and the believability of the map. The landmarks were clear and despite the size, players were able to recognize landmarks and not get lost.

However... there was one major issue. The map was way too big! 

Despite the players being able to pick up on navigation of the rooms they visited, too many of the rooms were left unexplored as they were too hard to find or get to. The layout was way too convoluted with way too many hallways and rooms that lead to nowhere interesting. Having nothing of value inside. The players were spread too thin for the ones who did venture out, and for the others, they were too overwhelmed to explore and stayed near the entrance where the action was. Ironically the area I spent the least amount of time and effort on, the outside, was the area that was played in the most and had the most praise.

My lack of multiplayer FPS experience was showing as I got a lot of comments saying this would work better as a single-player map rather than a multiplayer one.

For the next update, I really needed to fix things.
