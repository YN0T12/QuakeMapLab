# Playtesting and Iteration

## Playtesting Method

A group of designers and I challenged ourselves to create Quake multiplayer deathmatch maps together, and at the end of every week, we would play each other's maps and give feedback to each other using feedback forms. Thanks to this I was able to get good feedback on my map as well as discover things I like in other people's maps. Using their ideas to improve my own map. 

## Version 1 - Initial blockout

This version of the map can be see in the [Blockout](blockout.md) section of the Process Journal. as I mentioned there I designed this first blockout as close as I can to my initial top-down layout sketch (see: [Preproduction](preproduction.md))

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get as much playtesting as I liked after this version. The map was only played by 3 people including myself. Because of that, I couldn't get a really good playtest experience and I wasn't able to get the info I needed about the state of my map. Even so, I continued forward with my design trying to improve on it for the next playtest session.

## Version 2 - Iteration and Decoration

This version of the map saw the addition of decorations. Filling the empty rooms and spaces with props and set pieces helping the players not get so lost in the repeating white empty rooms. This also involved filling out large empty spaces with cover for players to hide behind.

Adding pipes and vents along the walls made the place feel more real and industrial. Potted plants as well as chairs and tables made it seem more welcoming to guests and gave employees a place to go during their breaks. And my favorite addition was the lab tables. This really helped to sell the idea that you were inside a lab and not some office building. These tables also helped fill out large empty spaces with some much-needed cover.

I was also able to finish the outside area which was just an empty space before. Although it wasn't very detailed and not too much work was put into the outside like the inside was.

But what did the playtesters think?

Luckily, this time I was able to do a larger play session having 8 players play on my map as it was meant to be played. I got a lot of praise for the decorations and the believability of the map. The landmarks were clear and despite the size, players were able to recognize landmarks and not get lost.

However... there was one major issue. The map was way too big! 

Despite the players being able to pick up on navigation of the rooms they visited, too many of the rooms were left unexplored as they were too hard to find or get to. The layout was way too convoluted with way too many hallways and rooms that led to nowhere interesting. Having nothing of value inside. The players were spread too thin for the ones who did venture out, and for the others, they were too overwhelmed to explore and stayed near the entrance where the action was. Ironically the area I spent the least amount of time and effort on, the outside, was the area that was played in the most and had the most praise.

My lack of multiplayer FPS experience was showing as I got a lot of comments saying this would work better as a single-player map rather than a multiplayer one.

For the next update, I really needed to fix things.

## Version 3 - The Big Update

This update was important as I needed to figure out how to fix my layout, and I needed to get a first draft of the textures and lighting.

The layout change resulted in a lot of the rooms being gutted out including The hallway, The Stage, The Attic, The Basement, and the Staircase room. The Storage room was also removed from the first floor and moved into the second floor where the staircase used to be, and the catwalks were extended with more ways to get up and down from them.

I removed the staircase from the back of the building and included ramps in the main Containment Room space. Hoping this would make the way up to the second floor a lot more obvious to the players.

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885551638356570112/1301579850376679474/image.png?ex=672849f2&is=6726f872&hm=384bd7d94ed2645b4ca88acd2bb740572e6872acb48f5ee1f60bd082e34c964e&" width="500" height="300">

All of these removals did come at a cost though. I felt like I ended up removing some of the standout parts of the map. Most notable was the removal of the Attic and the Basement.

The Attic was what I thought to be the most unique selling point of the map. A hidden away No-Mans zone on the top floor that gave players the best advantage, but if anyone else ended up there with you there was no cover and dangerous footing with the large holes in the floor leaving everyone wide open. That and the fact there was no ammo, armor, or health anywhere made it so players who did win in controlling that space would eventually have to go back down to refuel. Creating a kind of King-Of-The-Hill playstyle in the map. 

This idea was scrapped however due to the map being too large and hard to navigate already. I think with the changes I made however I could've probably left that room in the map, but in retrospect, I don't think it was a great idea. Having holes in the ceiling exposed to sunlight really improved the lighting of the map (see: [Textures and Lighting](textures-and-lighting.md)). Most importantly, the idea would've just been too campy and would've taken away from the rest of the map. I think the risk/reward gimmick with the Catwalks is a lot better and healthier of an idea than the King-Of-The-Hill gimmick with the Attic.

The removal of the Basement is another story. While I do think it didn't add anything to the layout of the map and would've probably been left not played in most of the time. The environmental storytelling really took a hit with its absence. The bloody floor and the tubes with the monsters inside with one of them being broken open really sold the idea that this place was destroyed and not just decayed and it gave a reason for the building being abandoned. I decided to move the broken containment tube to the main Containment Room as the centerpiece of the map, but without the blood and additional tubes, I think the story is missing.

As for the textures and lighting I did manage to get my first pass of it done in time despite all the layout changes. I think that texturing turned out great but the lighting took a hit from the lack of time. A lot of the inside map ended up too dark especially the rooms not exposed to sunlight from the ceiling and windows. While the outside of the map ended up too bright. That and all the snowy textures made the map blinding when stepping outside. (see: [Textures and Lighting](textures-and-lighting.md))

But what did the playtesters think?
